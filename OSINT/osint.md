From late 2023 to early 2024, an APT group has continued to target government entities in the Southeast region. Researchers have observed that this APT group is associated with decoy documents that deliver a downloader malware to its target machines. This downloader gathers information about the victim's computer then it encrypts gathered information using RC4 and Base64. Information includes operating system, network information, installed applications inside Program Files, and process listing.

You, as a threat analyst, were given this IOC to investigate on.

An old colleague bought me a superbly fantastic pizza as a present before Labor Day, three years ago, after I stopped by Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. She implied that she got it at a local pizzeria. Could you help me locate it and indicate the pizza shop reviews. Thankyyy! :)
